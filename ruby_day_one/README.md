# Do
* [Print the string “Hello, world.”](hello_world.rb)
* [For the string “Hello, Ruby,” find the index of the word “Ruby.”](find_ruby_index.rb)
* [Print your name ten times.](print_name_ten_times.rb)
* [Print the string “This is sentence number 1,” where the number 1 changes from 1 to 10.](this_is_sentence_x.rb)
* Run a Ruby program from a file. (ruby FILE_NAME.rb)
* [Bonus problem: If you’re feeling the need for a little more, write a program that picks a random number. Let a player guess the number, telling the player whether the guess is too low or too high.
(Hint: rand(10) will generate a random number from 0 to 9, and gets will read a string from the keyboard that you can translate to an integer.)](ruby_bouns_day_one.rb)
