# Find
* The Ruby API
* The free online version of Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Pro- grammer’s Guide [TFH08]
* A method that substitutes part of a string
* Information about Ruby’s regular expressions
* Information about Ruby’s ranges

# Do
* Print the string “Hello, world.”
* For the string “Hello, Ruby,” find the index of the word “Ruby.”
* Print your name ten times.
* Print the string “This is sentence number 1,” where the number 1 changes from 1 to 10.
* Run a Ruby program from a file.
* Bonus problem: If you’re feeling the need for a little more, write a program that picks a random number. Let a player guess the number, telling the player whether the guess is too low or too high.
(Hint: rand(10) will generate a random number from 0 to 9, and gets will read a string from the keyboard that you can translate to an integer.)
